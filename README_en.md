# Stay Away from EA
[中文原文](/README.md)

EA is the **worst** gaming company I've ever encountered. If you play games to have a good time and not to subject yourself to misery, **stay away from Electronic Arts (EA), and do not buy any of their games.**

- In the process of playing games with friends, four accounts have already been banned.
- The reasons provided are all empty.
- Appeals (Dispute) have only three chances, and once exceeded, they will ignore you.
- After waiting for half a day, EA responds to your email with a copy-paste:
  - `We have conducted a thorough investigation.`
  - `We found that the account suspension is correct.`
  - `We have conducted all possible investigations and will not reverse this decision.`
- Since they have thoroughly investigated, they should at least provide a reason for the ban. Sorry, this is our "internal procedure," and we can't tell you.
- Finding online customer service is more challenging than reaching the sky. EA has built a maze for you, and it's called EA Help.
- Confronting EA's online customer service during off-peak hours is likely futile. Besides helping you submit an appeal, they can't do much else.
- Online customer service may end the conversation without waiting for your reply. After the session ends, you cannot view the conversation history, and EA won't provide an archive of the session content.
